# JPACRUDProject
This project allows users to track certain cryptocurrency transactions. Users can enter the transaction type, price, amount (of coins) for each transaction. The user can then edit and/or delete those transactions.

## Technologies Used
This is a full CRUD program built using the JPA, Hibernate and SpringBoot. The combined implementation of Hibernate and JPA allows for the seamless marriage of object-oriented design and a relational database's objects. The web interface leverages features of SpringBoot (@Controller, @RequestMapping, @Service, @Autowired) to perform abstract manipulation on database objects through DAO methods based on web requests.

## Lessons Learned
I learned full CRUD implementation with specific focus on updating objects by retrieving managed entities and persisting updates from web forms. I solidified my ability to not only connect to a database, but also test those connections with JUNIT.
